"""Unit tests for diff_plans() in scripts/generate_plan.py.

diff_plans() compares two allWeeks lists and returns changelog entries using
pure set-difference logic:
  - Old weeks not in new  → "removed" entries
  - New weeks not in old  → "added" entries
  - Common weeks          → no entry (no "adjusted" type)

The "adjusted" change type is retired. This test suite covers the retired
behavior as regression anchors as well as the new set-difference behavior.

Mock strategy: plan_config must be injected into sys.modules before importing
generate_plan because generate_plan imports plan_config at module level.
